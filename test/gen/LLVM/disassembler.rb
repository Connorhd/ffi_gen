  # The type for the operand information call back function.  This is called to
  # get the symbolic information for an operand of an instruction.  Typically
  # this is from the relocation information, symbol table, etc.  That block of
  # information is saved when the disassembler context is created and passed to
  # the call back in the DisInfo parameter.  The instruction containing operand
  # is at the PC parameter.  For some instruction sets, there can be more than
  # one operand with symbolic information.  To determine the symbolic operand
  # information for each operand, the bytes for the specific operand in the
  # instruction are specified by the Offset parameter and its byte widith is the
  # size parameter.  For instructions sets with fixed widths and one symbolic
  # operand per instruction, the Offset parameter will be zero and Size parameter
  # will be the instruction width.  The information is returned in TagBuf and is 
  # Triple specific with its specific information defined by the value of
  # TagType for that Triple.  If symbolic information is returned the function
  # returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

  # The initial support in LLVM MC for the most general form of a relocatable
  # expression is "AddSymbol - SubtractSymbol + Offset".  For some Darwin targets
  # this full form is encoded in the relocation information so that AddSymbol and
  # SubtractSymbol can be link edited independent of each other.  Many other
  # platforms only allow a relocatable expression of the form AddSymbol + Offset
  # to be encoded.
  # 
  # The LLVMOpInfoCallback() for the TagType value of 1 uses the struct
  # LLVMOpInfo1.  The value of the relocatable expression for the operand,
  # including any PC adjustment, is passed in to the call back in the Value
  # field.  The symbolic information about the operand is returned using all
  # the fields of the structure with the Offset of the relocatable expression
  # returned in the Value field.  It is possible that some symbols in the
  # relocatable expression were assembly temporary symbols, for example
  # "Ldata - LpicBase + constant", and only the Values of the symbols without
  # symbol names are present in the relocation information.  The VariantKind
  # type is one of the Target specific #defines below and is used to print
  # operands like "_foo@GOT", ":lower16:_foo", etc.
